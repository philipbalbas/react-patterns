## Compound Components

- Allows passing of implicit state to child components

### Before
```
<Counter>
  {open && <Menu />}
  <Button onClick={onClick} />
</Counter>
```
### After
```
<Counter>
  <Counter.Menu />
  <Counter.Button />
</Counter>
```

## Render Props

- Allows developer to choose how they want to render a component
- Component is in handles state, parent handles rendering

--- 

## Prop Collection

- Used in conjunction with render props
- Allows passing of multiple props to relevant components that need them

--- 

## Prop Getters

- Prevents overwriting handlers that prop collections can't handle

### Problem
```
<div>
  <Button open={open} {...togglerProps} />
  <button {...togglerProps} onClick={() => console.log(clicked)} >Click here</button>
  {open && <Menu>Menu</Menu>}
</div>
```

## State Reducer

- Adopted from reason-react
- While render props controls how UI is rendered, state reducers controls state logic

---



## Provider 

- Provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level
- Allows sharing of "global" data to components
